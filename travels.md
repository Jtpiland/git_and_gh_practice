I went on a trip to the northeast a few years ago that was incredible.  Flied into Boston from Austin for tour of the city. Went to Portland for lobster rolls and delicious Oxbow pilsner. On to Burlington where we attended a grafting camp for an amazing cider producer. They took us to a maple sugar shack in the middle of the woods and we drank incredible natural wine from VT. An amazing vacation!
