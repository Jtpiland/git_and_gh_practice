I've been brewing beer for almost ten years.  Something that has been on my mind for the last few years is "You don't see a lot of old brewers." Unless you are in Europe where the lifestyle seems like it could be possible. This planted the seed for a career transition. I am lucky to have a couple great friends who have gone through this same transition and offered me quite a bit of guidance. I just was not quite ready to take the plunge.

Fast forward a few years and I really started looking for directions I could go. One thing that became more and more important to me is that the idea of working remote. My partner and I love to travel. However, both of us working in the hospitality industry makes that more and more difficult.

Between the possibility of working remote and the potential to make a better salary to take care of my family, it seemed like Turing was meant to be.
